# Bayesian machine learning

Time. The course consists in 8 × 2 hours of lectures, and 4 × 2 hours of practicals, totalling 24 hours. We are of course open to discussion and we can easily compress that total.

Evaluation. Evaluation is project-based, each project revolving around a research paper. The number of students by project will depend on the number of students in the class.


## Lecturers
* Rémi Bardenet (CNRS, Univ. Lille)
* Julyan Arbel (Inria, Univ. Grenoble-Alpes)

## Objective of the course
By the end of the course, the students should
* have a high-level view of the main approaches to making decisions under uncertainty.
* be able to detect when being Bayesian helps and why.
* be able to design and run a Bayesian ML pipeline for standard supervised or unsupervised
learning.
* have a global view of the current limitations of Bayesian approaches and the research
landscape.
* be able to understand the abstract of most Bayesian ML papers.

## Topics
* Decision theory
* 50 shades of Bayes: Subjective and objective interpretations
* Bayesian supervised and unsupervised learning
* Advanced Monte Carlo methods
* Bayesian nonparametrics
* Bayesian methods for deep learning

## Prerequisites
* It is recommended to have followed either the course of P. Latouche and N. Chopin on "Probabilistic graphical models" or the course of S. Allassonière on "computational statistics".
* A working knowledge of Python is required for practical sessions.

## Organization of courses
* 6x2 hours of lectures
* 4x2 hours of practicals
* 4 hours of "student seminars" for the evaluation.
* All classes and material will be in English. Students can write their final report either in French or English.

## Validation
* Students form groups. Each group reads and reports on a research paper. We expect a dash of creativity: students should identify a weakness of the paper, and try to push in that direction. This can mean extending a proof, implementing another feature, investigating different experiments, etc. Deliverables are a small report and a short oral presentation in front of the class.
